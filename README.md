===================

This is a volunteer project to provide real time rocket alerts for the citizens of Israel. This is my first Android project, which was written during the weekend; please don't judge my skills by it. :-)

Pull requests and improvements are more than welcome. Most requested features from users:

* Option to select notification sound type
* Option to mute alerts
* Option to override silent mode
* Make area selection more friendly (search city/area, show selected on top, ...)
* Show last alerts
* Add support for older devices (Android 2+)
* Our own GCM server? Currently we use Parse.
