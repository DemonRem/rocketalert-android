===================

This is a volunteer project to provide real time rocket alerts for the citizens of Israel. This is my first Android project, which was written during the weekend; please don't judge my skills by it. :-)

Pull requests and improvements are more than welcome. Most requested features from users:

* ~~Option to select notification sound type~~
* ~~Option to mute alerts~~
* Make area selection more friendly (search city/area, show selected on top, ...): https://github.com/arikfr/rocketalert-android/issues/1
* Show past alerts: https://github.com/arikfr/rocketalert-android/issues/4
* Option to override silent mode: https://github.com/arikfr/rocketalert-android/issues/3
* Add support for older devices (Android 2+): https://github.com/arikfr/rocketalert-android/issues/2
* Our own GCM server? Currently we use Parse.
